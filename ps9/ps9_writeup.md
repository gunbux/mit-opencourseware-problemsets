1. What is the algorithmic complexity of greedyAdvisor?
- The algorithmic complexity of greedyAdvisor should be linear O(n).
2. What is the algorithmic complexity of bruteForceAdvisor?
- The algorithmic complexity of bruteForceAdvisor should be O(n!)
3. Assuming 1 microsecond (1 microsecond = 1Ã—10^-6 seconds) to compute the value of a
solution in bruteForceAdvisor, how much time in years (365 days per year) would it take
for bruteForceAdvisor to find an optimal solution for the following number of subjects:
1. 8 subjects? 0.403 seconds
2. 16 subjects? 0.6634 years
3. 32 subjects? 
4. 321 subjects (the number of courses in the problem set)?
