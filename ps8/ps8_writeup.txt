The total population of the virus before the drug was introduced (t = 0 to t = 150) follows a logarithmic growth. The total population after the drug is introduced follows a sawtooth negative exponential growth downwards. On the other hand, the graph of the total population of resistant virus follows a constant sawtooth graph. This trend is somewhat consistent with intuition because as more and more of the virus mutates and develops a resistance to the drug, there is also a higher chance the virus will mutate to no longer have immunity for the drug as well.
